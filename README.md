# Welcome to My Bsq
***

## Task
My_bsq is an algorithm project where a program has to find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.  
The board is represented by a file passed as the program's argument and the program must print the board, with some empty
spaces replaced by "x" to represent the largest square found.

## Description


## Installation
Set up the my_bsq program by using the make command to compile the necessary files.  After the my_bsq file is created, the program is ready for use.

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
$>./my_bsq map10x10
..xx.
.oxxo
.....
.o...

```
