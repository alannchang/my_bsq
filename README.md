# Welcome to My Bsq
***

## Task
My_bsq is an algorithm project where a program has to find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.  

## Description
The board is represented by a file passed as the program's argument and the program must print the board, with some empty
spaces replaced by "x" to represent the largest square found.

## Installation
Set up the my_bsq program by using the make command to compile the necessary files.  After the my_bsq file is created, the program is ready for use.

## Usage
An example usage would be given a file map5x5 with its first line being the number of lines in the map and the map itself:
```
5
.....
.o..o
.....
.o...
o...o
```
If you were to run the my_bsq program on the map5x5 file, you would get the first biggest square found by the program:
```
$>./my_bsq map5x5
..xx.
.oxxo
.....
.o...
o...o
$>
```
